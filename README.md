# HotelReservationsVue

A **webm** file at the root location of the repository **shows how the application works**.

Application was built in a way that allows a **comparison of multiple different framework constructs from Angular, React and Vue** - those have their own repositories. Example contructs compared are: 
* dynamic components,
* state management & its incorporation into components,
* working with routing,
* styling of components etc.

The repositories contain a simple frontend application for Hotel Reservations and is used used for a comparison of Angular/React/Vue in the context of the same application but separate implementations.
